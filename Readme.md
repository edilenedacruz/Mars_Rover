# Mars Rover Challenge

This is my solution for the exercise Mars Rover Challenge in the Ruby language.

#### Setup

If you are not cloning this from GitHub, please skip step 1.

1. Clone down the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/edilenedacruz/Mars_Rover.git
```

2. Enter the folder
```
$ cd Mars_Rover
```

3. Then install required gems

```
$ bundle
```

4. Then run the game
```
$ ruby lib/runner.rb
```

5. To run the tests
```
$ rake
```

6. If you prefer you can also run tests individually
```
$ ruby test/"file_name".rb
```
